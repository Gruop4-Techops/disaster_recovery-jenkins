## Rescuing a Crashing Jenkins instance
***
1.  Install your thinBackup plugin
2.  Create your backup directory in the backend of your jenkins master machine
3.  make sure the backup directory is on a different user but with jenkins having access to that directory.
4.  Configure your thinBackup plugin according to the parameters that you wish. 
5. Once youâ€™ve saved and done, you click on restore, and you choose the date in which you performed the backup and then you click on restore. _It will then pull down all the jobs, plugins and other configuration files that was backed up into your backup directory._
